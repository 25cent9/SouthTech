		Lil Boosie cousin Young Bleed introduced Boosie to Baton Rouge rapper C-Loc in the late 1990s.[2] He was mentored by Young Bleed & C-Loc, and joined the group Concentration Camp, as the youngest member at the age 14 in 1996. The group consists of Young Bleed, C-Loc, Happy Perez, Boo, Max Minelli, J-Von, Lee Tyme & Lucky Knuckles. He eventually debuted on C-Loc’s fifth album, ‘It’s A Gamble’ in 2000 under his old alias Boosie and Concentration Camp third studio album Camp III : Thug Brothas in 2000.[3] The departure of Young Bleed from the Camp helped put Lil Boosie in a prime position amongst the group. Alongside C-Loc and Max Minelli, he served as one of the “faces” of the Camp. At 17 years of age, he recorded his debut album, the aptly-titled Youngest of da Camp, (Camp Life Entertainment, 2000). The album production was mostly handled by Happy Perez, and featured C-Loc, Max Minelli and Donkey.[4]
		In 2001 he joined Trill Entertainment backed by its CEO the late Pimp C of UGK. Soon after, Trill independently released the album For My Thugz under his new alias Lil Boosie in 2002.[5] The album featured Pimp C, Young Bleed, Webbie while he also put out his first mixtape title Boosie 2002 (Advance) featuring contributions by Max Minelli and Pimp C.
