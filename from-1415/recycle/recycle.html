	Help the Earth - Recycle
</h1>

<p>
	It is time for our annual recycling drive! Recycling means taking a product or material at the end of its useful life and making it a usable raw material to make another product. We have been very successful with paper and plastic products. Last year, we recycled more items than our previous three years. Let's try to do it again this year. We will have a dinner for everyone involved with the recycle drive on Saturday night. We hope to dee you all there.
